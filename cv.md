# About Me

I worked in electronics stores and also took part in a start-up. In each project, I grew as a specialist due to my activity and interest in the result. In each company, I grew up the career ladder to leadership positions. During my work, I learned to work in a team, find a common language with different people, take responsibility for the result and achieve my goals.

Today I want to develop in the field of development. Interesting frontend. I like to see the result of my work, I like to develop and learn new things.
